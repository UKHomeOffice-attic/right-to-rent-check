You can add another person now if their circumstances are similar, for instance they are already living in the property/are not living in the property.

Remember they must also be 18 or over, already in the UK and unable to provide documents (if they can provide documents you should do the check yourself)

There will be an opportunity after you have submitted this form to start a new request.
