## Introductory cookie message

When you first use the service we show a ‘cookie message’. We then store a cookie on your computer so it knows not to show this message again.

## Measuring site use

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how you use this service. This helps us check it’s meeting your needs and make improvements.

Google Analytics stores information about:

* how you got to the site
* pages you visit and how long you spend on them
* what you click on

No personal details are stored with this information, so you can’t be identified.
