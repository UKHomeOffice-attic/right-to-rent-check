# Right to Rent Check

## Running the app

you can run the app locally with 

`npm start`

Note: this will need a local redis instance running. 

You can then access your service in a browser at http://localhost:8080.

Alternatively, a basic docker-compose configuration is included, which will bundle redis and an nginx proxy. Run docker-compose up to start these services. You can then access your service in a browser at https://localhost.
