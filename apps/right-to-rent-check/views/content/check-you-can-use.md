# Confirming you can use this service

Use this service if the person doesn't have documents for any of the following reasons:

* they have an outstanding application with the Home Office / the Home Office has their documents
* they’ve lost their immigration documents and applied for replacements
* they don’t have documents but the Home Office has given them special permission to rent

If the person has documents, you should [do the right to rent checks yourself](https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/how-to-check) and you don’t need to use this tool.
